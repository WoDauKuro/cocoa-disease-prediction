# Cocoa Bean Contamination Detection

A computer vision system for detecting diseased cocoa beans using YOLOv8 object detection. Identifies three classes: Anthracnose (fungal disease), CSSVD (Cocoa Swollen Shoot Virus Disease), and healthy beans.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project is part of the [Amini Cocoa Contamination Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/amini-cocoa-contamination-challenge), which focuses on identifying visual symptoms of cocoa diseases â€” **Anthracnose** and **CSSVD** â€” using object detection techniques. The goal is to support early disease detection to improve cocoa crop yield and farmer outcomes.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available from these sources:

- **Zindi Africa**: [Amini Cocoa Contamination Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/amini-cocoa-contamination-challenge/data)
- **Kaggle**: [Amini Cocoa Contamination Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ohagwucollinspatrick/amini-cocoa-contamination-dataset)

## ðŸ”§ Potential Improvements

While the model achieved promising results within the allowed training time, there are several areas for potential improvement:

- **Extended Training Time**: The challenge permitted up to ~9 hours for model training, but this implementation only used approximately **2 hours and 20 minutes** on a Kaggle Notebook with a **P100 GPU**. Utilizing the full training window could allow for:
  - More training epochs
  - Improved convergence
  - Better generalization

- **Data Augmentation**: Additional augmentation techniques such as MixUp, Mosaic, CutMix, or random erasing could help the model become more robust to variations in bean appearance and backgrounds.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Exploring different learning rates, batch sizes, and image sizes may yield performance improvements.

- **Model Architecture**: While YOLOv8 performed well, experimenting with larger YOLOv8 variants (e.g., `yolov8m` or `yolov8l`) or alternative architectures (like Faster R-CNN or EfficientDet) could enhance accuracy â€” given more compute time.

- **Ensembling**: Combining predictions from multiple models trained with different seeds or architectures could improve final predictions.
